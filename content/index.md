This site is my personal hypertext garden on the internet. I call it a "Rhizome" because at a certain level its just pseudo-random root network connecting thoughts/resources/ideas into something tractable; a web addressable and mutable extension of my brain. Its small now but should grow overtime.

Currently in progress from porting notes/links from [my hackmd page](https://hackmd.io/@elijahc), among other places

See the Explore section (left) for a list of pages or a full [list of pages by tag](/tags)
