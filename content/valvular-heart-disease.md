# Aortic stenosis
>  [!tip] Grading severity
> 
>  Just memorize the moderate cutoffs (25 to 40mmHg), anything below is mild, above is severe

- thickened LV caused by pushing against a fixed outlet
- CPP = DBP - LVEDP
- **Avoid hypotension**: hypertrophied LV means increased LVEDP, higher O2 demand 
- **Avoid bradycardia**: essentially "fixed" SV -> CO is HR dependent -> slow HR siginficantly reduces CO
- **Avoid Tachycardia**: Tachycardia inreases oxygen demand, shortens diastole (when LV is perfused) -> decr coronary perfusion pressure
- Pressor of choice: **Phenylephrine** -> for incr BP and relative bradycardia

# Aortic regurgitation
- Regurgitation happens during **diastole**, when the AV _should_ be closed
- **Relative tachycardia**: incr HR -> decr time in diastole -> minimize regurgitation
- **Improve forward flow** and decr LVEDP with vasodilators, decr SVR
- Induction goals: maintain relative tachycardia and incr DBP to maintain CPP
- Pressor of choice: **Epi** or **Norepi** 

# Mitral stenosis
Almost always rheumatic in origin. Incr left atrial pressure may cause AFib and pulmonary edema
- Elevated LA pressure -> incr pulmonary venous pressure and PVR -> pHTN -> TR, RV failure
- **Avoid tachycardia**: MS -> less LV filling for a given time -> tachycardia shorter diastole -> less filling -> decr CO
  - Continue any digoxin, CCB, BB perioperatively
  - chemically or electrically cardiovert any AFib

- **Avoid pHTN**: O2, hypocarbia, alkalosis, nitrates, veletri/iNO all **decr PVR**
- **Hypotension**: may indicate RV failure and/or need for inotropes or pulmonary vasodilators

# Mitral regurgitation
Caused by mitral valve prolapse (myxomatous degeneration), ischemic heart disease, pap rupture
- MR allows blood to backflow from LV to LA during systole, EF usually overestimated as regurgitant fraction not accounted for
- **Relative tachycardia**: is desirable to decr ventricular filling time
- **Afterload reduction**: incr SVR -> worsens regurg causing more regurg as LA lower resistance
- **Maintain preload**: Very preload dependent as SV only partially ejected
