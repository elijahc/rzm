Patients come into the hospital once they begin the *active* part of labor. OB anesthesiologists get involved to provide analgesia during both labor, delivery (C-section or vaginal), and post partum

# Labor Analgesia
Labor can be prolonged and painful, the most flexible option for pain control during labor is a lumbar epidural or a Combined Spinal Epidural (CSE). A lumbar epidural only will need a bolus/load.

## CSE Dosing

|                                  |               Opiate               | Local           |
|----------------------------------|:----------------------------------:|-----------------|
| 0cm - 4cm _or_<br>"walking PCEA" | Fent 10-25mcg or<br>Sufent 2.5-mcg | None            |
| 4cm - 8cm                        | Fent 10-25mcg                      | 0.5mL of B0.25% |
| 8cm - 10cm                       | Fent 10-25mcg                      | 1.0mL of B0.25% |

- Always draw up spinal dose before skin local in the following order: Bupi -> Morphine -> Fent

## Epidural only
- **Bupi 0.125%** + **Fent 5mcg/mL**
  - Can use Bupi 0.25% may be used in advanced labor but will cause motor block and needs attending approval

## PCEA settings
- Stock concentration is **Bupi 0.08%** + **Fent 2mcg/mL**

|                          |    **Basal**   | **PCEA bolus** |
|-------------------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
|       **"walking" PCEA** |    5cc/hr CONT |         _None_ |
|        **Standard PCEA** | 5cc/30min PIEB |    5cc q 10min |
| **Intrathecal catheter** |     2-3cc CONT |         _None_ |

- remember: LA requirements reduced by 30% in pregnancy
- assess frequently for motor block
- Consider incr PIEB dosing if inadequate level despite button
  - 6cc/30min or 10cc/45min

## Safety Tips
- Motor block is intrathecal catheter until proven otherwise
- High block (above T2-4) is intrathecal until proven otherwise
- Lack of block is intravascular catheter until proven otherwise
- Nausea after spinal or epidural dose is hypotension until proven otherwise
- Patchy bblock is likely a subdural catheter; Plan to replace

# Cesarean Delivery

## CS with epidural
Cesarean deliveries under epidural require a more dense analgesia than laboring.
Typical LA dose is **20cc bolus** for cesarean delivery (T4 level) but some parturients may require up to 40cc.
C-Section's can occur across a spectrum of urgencies and will impact LA choice.

- Emergent  ->  **20cc 3% 2-CP**
  - This is **least toxic**, has the **fastest onset**, but is **short duration** (<45min)
  - May need to bolus Bupi 0.25% in PACU to cover pain until morphine hits

- Non-emergent  ->  **1-20cc LEBF** (see table below)
  - LEBF is a mix of Lido + Epi + Bicarb + Fentanyl
  - after 20cc of lido if more LA needed always switch to 2-CP for LAST considerations

| **Component** | **Dose**<br>_(per mL LA)_ | **Max Dose** |
|---------------|:-------------------------:|--------------|
| **L**ido 2%   | 1-19mL                    | 20cc         |
| **E**pi       | 2-5 mcg                   | 40-100mcg    |
| **B**icarb    | 0.1mL                     | 2mL          |
| **F**entanyl  | 100mcg                    |              |


## CS with spinal
A cesarean spinal mix should contain **Local anesthetic (LA)** + **Fent** +/- **morphine or dilaudid** +/- **Epi**

|  **Component**  |     **Primary**     |     **Alternative**     |
|:---------------:|:-------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| LA (Bupi 0.75%) | 1.5cc (11mg)        | 1.6cc (12mg)            |
| Fast narcotic   | fent 12.5 - 25mcg   |                         |
| Long narcotic   | morphine 100-250mcg | hydromorphone 50-100mcg |
| Prolong         | Epi 100-200mcg      |                         |

- CSE is also an option if 12-48hrs of extended analgesia is needed
- 2nd dose of neuraxial morphine can be given prior to epidural removal at ~18-24h mark

## CS with GETA
Almost all GETA C-sections are emergent. Anes Att. (preferably OB) should **always** be present for induction. **No exceptions**
- Preoxygenate immediately w/ 100% FiO2 by facemask
- RSI w/ **hypnotic** + **succinylcholine** with **cricoid pressure** (required)
- Hypnotics
  - **Etomidate** 0.2-0.3mg/kg (most *readily availble* and *HDS*)
  - **Ketamine** 1-1.5mg/kg IV
  - **Propofol** 1.5-2.5mg/kg 
- Acute hypertension adjuncts
  - lido 1.5 mg/kg
  - esmolol 0.5-1 mg/kg
  - labetalol 5-20 mg
  - nitroglycerin 2mcg/kg
  - remi 1mcg/kg

- in emergent GA use high conc. sevo (1-1.5 MAC) w/ 100% FiO2 until delivery
  - After delivery reduce to <0.5MAC to prevent **uterine atony**. Supplement with N2O 50-70%
  - Consider switching to TIVA; ask attending.


# Postpartum tubal ligation
Discuss use of epidural vs single shot spinal (SSS) with attending
Regardless of choice, **never** use neuraxial **long acting opioids**

- if using **epidural**:
  - 2-chloroprocaine 3% *or*
  - Lidocaine 2%
- if using **spinal**:
   - Heavy bupi (0.75%) 11-12mg + Fent 15-25mcg

These are NOT elective cases per ACOG, however following NPO guidelinens is mandatory

# Cervical Cerclage
- Spinal preferred; T10 level required
- Subarachnonid block is most commonly used w/ 7.5mg spinal bupi + fent 10-25mcg
- Do not use long acting opioids
