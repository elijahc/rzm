# ITE Knowledge gaps 2023

## Brainstem reflexes and brain death?

**Brainstem death criteria**
- Persistent Coma
    - Absent verbal, movement, eye response to pain (e.g. GCS 3)
- Absent brainstem reflexes
    - Many types
- Cannot breath without assistance
    - Over 10min: No breaths OR PaCO2 increase >20mmHg

:::warning
Must satisfy all 3 criteria
:::


### Imaging findings consistent with brain death

- **CTA - Considered best**
- CT Scan look for:
    - Loss of grey white matter differentiation
    - Diffuse Edema
        - Effacement of Sulcus/Ventricle/basilar cistern

#### Other ancillary testing

- MRA
- Transcranial doppler
- EEG
- SSEP/MEP

## Opiates

**Which metabolite of Hydromorphone will accumulate in renal insufficiency and may cause neuroexcitation and cognitive impairment?**

:::spoiler
        **Hydromorphone-3-glucoronide (H3G)**
:::

### Hepatic opiate metabolism
::: info
**Goal**: make drugs more hydrophillic (e.g. acetylation, glucuronidation)
**Why**: Renal excretion typically follows hepatic modification
:::

#### Metabolism Phases
- Phase 1: Oxidation or hydrolysis via P450 system
- Phase 2: Conjugation
    - *Phase 1 usually preceeds phase 2 but not always*


:::warning
**Main players**: CYP3A4 and CYP2D6
:::

### ESRD and Opiates
> What happens if :no_entry_sign: beans

|    Safest    | Use with caution |   Avoided   |
|:------------:|:----------------:|:-----------:|
|  *Fentanyl*  | *Hydromorphone*  | *Morphine*  |
|  Sufentanil  |    Oxycodone     | Hydrocodone |
| Remifentanil |                  | Meperidine  |
|  Methadone   |                  |   Codeine   |

::: warning
* *most commonly encountered*
**Main culprits**: M3G, H3G, Normaperidine
:::

#### Opiate neuroexcitation symptoms
- Agitation
- Confusion
- Hallucinations
- Myoclonus
- Seizures

## Drugs that attenuate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction

:::spoiler
Ace-I, CCB, nitrates, prostacyclin, GA (volatile > IV)
:::



---


## Why does :arrow_up: BMI = :arrow_up: succinylcholine resistance

:::spoiler
- **Increased** butyrcholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity
:::

### Pseudocholinesterase deficiency

Slows metabolism of:
- Succinylcholine
- Remifentanil
- Mivacurium
- Procaine/Cocaine
- Heroin

:::success
**Think**: very short acting drugs
:::



---


## Cardiac symptoms during ECT
- Incrases in HR or BP are normal, (can also see bradycardia)



---

How does hypoalbuminemia cause alkalosis

:::spoiler
- Albumin is a **weak acid**
:::

### Strong ions, Strong ion difference (SID)
